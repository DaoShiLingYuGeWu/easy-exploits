# easy-exploits

The current repository contains exploits of different CVE IDs that I identified in the past.


## Motivation

The main purpose of this repository is to give an easy access to these exploits, since they are mentioned in each published manuscript and needed to be formatted, in order to be executed.

## Method and results

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.


## Repository overview

Each directory is separated based on the affected protocol that the attack is escalated and the relevant CVE ID.
