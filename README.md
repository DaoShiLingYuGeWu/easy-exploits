# easy-exploits

The current repository contains exploits of different CVE IDs that were identified in the past by me (CVE-2021-37910, CVE-2021-40288, CVE-2021-41435, CVE-2021-41436,  CVE-2021-41437, CVE-2021-41441, CVE-2021-41442, CVE-2021-41445, CVE-2021-41449, CVE-2021-41450, CVE-2021-41451, CVE-2021-41753, CVE-2021-41788, CVE-2021-46353).


## Motivation

The main purpose of this repository is to give an easy access to these exploits, since they are mentioned in each published manuscript and needed to be formatted, in order to be executed.


## Repository overview

Each directory is separated based on the affected protocol that the attack is escalated and the relevant CVE ID.
