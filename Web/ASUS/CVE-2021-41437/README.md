## Intro
This vulnerability is related to CWE-113. Namely, an HTTP response splitting attack occurs when the assailant passes malicious data to 
the Web app and the latter includes these data in its response. Only one Web app (CVE-2021-41437) was
found to be vulnerable to this attack from our study (https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/1833062.pdf). 

## Attack details
Specifically, this Web app is vulnerable to partial code execution; that is, the attacker crafts a specific URL 
and sends it towards the victim, namely, the WAP's admin; note that the admin must be at that time connected to the Web app. After the victim clicks on that URL, they will receive two 
HTTP responses. First, if that URL exceeds 50 characters in length after the query ("?") parameter, the Web app will redirect the request to "cloud_sync.asp?flag=" web page 
(i.e., a cloud service provided by this WAP). The second HTTP response is received after the aforesaid redirection and at minimum contains a ticket (invitation) to access the aforementioned
service. 

Precisely, any value the attacker enters after the query parameter is unjustifiably processed from the Web app and translated into an ASUS AiCloud 2.0 invitation. For
example, in case the attacker sends the "/?password=asdasdasddddddddddasddddddddddddddddddabh" URL, the
Web app will redirect the user to "cloud_sync.asp?flag=?password=asdasdasddddddddddasddddddddddddddddddabh" URL, eventually executing the query parameters the
attacker has included. Note that the opponent is not required to have any prior knowledge for such a URL to work, but the user must be already logged in. Otherwise, the Web app will redirect the user to the default login Web page.

Specifically, this issue relates to the ASUS AiCloud 2.0, i.e., a service which allows WAP (Wi-Fi) users to connect remotely and gain access to their data. Simply put, this service
links the local network with a proprietary online cloud storage service with the use of invitation codes. Any Wi-Fi user can access this service by the AiCloud mobile app (offered for
both iOS and Android) or through a Web app from a typical (desktop) browser. As a result, the attacker can possibly gain access to the data a user has already stored in this cloud
service. In an even worse case, the perpetrator could possibly infiltrate the local network. MITRE has already reserved CVE-2021-41437 to inform about this vulnerability.

## Mitigation
As stated in firmware description of ASUS RT-AX88U v3.0.0.4.388.20558 (https://www.asus.com/us/Networking-IoT-Servers/WiFi-Routers/ASUS-Gaming-Routers/RT-AX88U/HelpDesk_BIOS/)
This issue is now fixed.
